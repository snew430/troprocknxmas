            Buckle in and join John Patti Sr. for a two-hour trip to beaches,
            tiki bars, and holiday parties. There will be plenty of Trop Rock
            tunes along the way from some of your favorite artists like current
            Coral Reefers Peter Mayer, Doyle Grisham, Nadirah Shakor and
            original Coral Reefer Roger Bartlett. We will even go south of
            border with Brent Burns and mix up a batch of gumbo with The Sauce
            Boss.

            A tasty gift idea! Vaccaro's Italian Pastry Shop has created a
            "sweet treat" exclusively for listeners of "A Trop Rockin'
